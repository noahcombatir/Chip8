# Chip8 Emulator

A simple Chip8 emulator built using SDL2 for rendering and input handling implemented per [CHIP-8 Instruction Set](https://github.com/mattmikolay/chip-8/wiki/CHIP%E2%80%908-Instruction-Set) and [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8)

This project aims to faithfully emulate the Chip8 virtual machine and its games, providing an easy way to run classic Chip8 ROMs on modern systems.
